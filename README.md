# quik-stack
A new way to do webdev

This is an easy-clone boilerplate for creating a website using quik-server

It adds jsx, and an ability to call backend functions without having to setup an api/route for them.
The code is designed as an example with server.js being the backend starting point, and website.jsx as the frontend starting point.


#to-do
